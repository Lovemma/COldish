# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II


**Description: **

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example:**

Given *nums1* = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, *nums2* = `[2, 2]`, return `[2, 2]`.

**Note:**

- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if *nums1*'s size is small compared to *nums2*'s size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of *nums2* are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

**Solution:**

```python
class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(nums1) < len(nums2):
            nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
        c = collections.Counter(nums1)
        ans = []
        for x in nums2:
            if c[x] > 0:
                ans.append(x)
                c[x] = c[x] - 1
        return ans
```
